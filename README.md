# Missile Impact Probability Analysis

This project simulates and analyzes the probability of a missile impact on a target located in a 2D field. It calculates both experimental and theoretical probabilities for different numbers of missile warheads and varying field sizes.

## Features
- Simulation of missile impacts with random placement of targets and warheads.
- Calculation of theoretical and experimental probabilities.
- Visualization of results using matplotlib.
- Analysis for different numbers of warheads (1, 3, 5, 10).
- Support for customizable field sizes and probability values.
